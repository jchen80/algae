# algaeModel
The file algMod.py contains code for a convolutional neural network model and a transfer convolutional network model based off of the VGG16 model from the keras module. The model's purpose was to classify an image of a water surface as either containing algae or not. The classification of water surface images was part of a project initiative proposing to use the CNN to sort through images of a water reservoir taken by a drone in order to detect harmful algal blooms in a timely manner. 

was trained on a set of images showing water surfaces with and without algae contamination. A
